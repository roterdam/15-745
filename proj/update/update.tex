\begin{question}{Major Changes}
There have been no major changes in our goals since the project proposal. 
We have however realized that the way we divided the optimization into parts -
coalescing \code{map} operations, coalescing \code{map} and \code{reduce} operations and 
coalescing \code{map} and \code{filter} operations - was not necessary, and we
have modified our plan to account for that.
\end{question}
\begin{question}{What you have accomplished so far}
We have formalized our implementation plans for this project by clearly
defining the grammar for the updated C0 language that we are designing. We have
also written up typing rules and have come up with an initial dataflow pass to
determine how far to delay executing \code{map}, \code{filter} and \code{reduce}
operations - as a first step to being able to then coalesce operations together.
We are most of the way to a fully functioning \code{C1} to C compiler, and will be in
a position to start working on the optimizations within half a week. 
\end{question}

\begin{question}{Meeting your milestone}
We have fallen behind on our goal of being able to coaslece consecutive
\code{map} operations. This has been because of two reasons - firstly we 
restructured our implementation plans and seconldy because we have not 
been able to put in as much time as we wanted to into this project due to 
other unexpectedly pressing matters which came up.
\end{question}

\begin{question}{Surprises}
There have been no major surprises in our tackling of the problem. 
\end{question}

\begin{question}{Revised Schedule}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{8cm}|c|c|}
\hline 
Work to do & Deadline & Who \\ \hline
Write a pass over the AST to push \code{map} and \code{filter} operations as
far down the program as possible in the straight-line-code case. &
May 22nd & Rokhini \\ \hline
Write a complementary pass, that coalesces adjacent sequence operations into
single operations on new functions. & May 25th & Michael \\ \hline 
Extend the above code to work for loops and conditionals. & May 29th &
Michael and Rokhini \\ \hline
Write the final report & May 2nd & Michael and Rokhini \\ \hline

\begin{question}{Resources Needed}
We have the resources we need, and don't require any other materials.
